"""
Google Drive File Lister with local-path-to-folder-ID resolution

This script authenticates a user via OAuth2 and lists files from a folder in Google Drive.

Usage:
    python list_drive_files.py [LOCAL_PATH]

If LOCAL_PATH is provided (relative or absolute within the Google Drive desktop-mount),
the script attempts to traverse the folder tree by matching each directory name in Google Drive.
If not provided, it lists files from the Drive root.

Requirements:
    - credentials.json must be in the same directory as this script.
    - Google API client libraries must be installed:
        pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Note:
    This approach relies on folder names in the local path matching exactly the corresponding
    Google Drive folder names. If multiple folders share the same name at a level, the first
    encountered in the Drive API listing is used.
