    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on my recent visit to Stockholm has been a deeply emotional and meaningful experience. Returning to the iconic Konserthuset at Hötorget, where the Nobel Prize ceremony is held every December, brought back a flood of memories. It was a poignant moment to walk through those familiar halls, reminiscent of the time I attended the Nobel ceremony in 2003 with my parents. The ceremony's invitations, schedule, and speeches from that day still hold a special place in my heart.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of this visit was reuniting with my former PhD supervisor, Professor Astrid Gräslund, who served as the secretary of the Nobel Prize Committee for Chemistry. Meeting her again after a decade evoked memories of her invaluable mentorship and the guidance she provided during my research journey.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting the Svante Arrhenius Laboratory at Stockholm University was another significant moment. This laboratory was my academic home for eight transformative years, where I engaged in impactful research, expanded my knowledge, and forged enduring relationships. Standing before the statue of Svante Arrhenius, whose work had inspired me since my high school days, was a surreal and gratifying experience.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip wasn't just a nostalgic journey—it rekindled deep emotions, gratitude, and a profound appreciation for the enduring connections that have shaped my life. I am thankful for these experiences and inspired by the cyclical nature of life, where past and present intertwine to create a tapestry of memories and growth.
