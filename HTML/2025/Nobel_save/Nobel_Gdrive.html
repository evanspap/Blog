    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on my recent visit to Stockholm has been a deeply emotional and meaningful experience. Returning to the iconic Konserthuset at HÃ¶torget, where the Nobel Prize ceremony is held every December, brought back a flood of memories. It was a poignant moment to walk through those familiar halls, reminiscent of the time I attended the Nobel ceremony in 2003 with my parents. The ceremony's invitations, schedule, and speeches from that day still hold a special place in my heart.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of this visit was reuniting with my former PhD supervisor, Professor Astrid GrÃ¤slund, who served as the secretary of the Nobel Prize Committee for Chemistry. Meeting her again after a decade evoked memories of her invaluable mentorship and the guidance she provided during my research journey.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting the Svante Arrhenius Laboratory at Stockholm University was another significant moment. This laboratory was my academic home for eight transformative years, where I engaged in impactful research, expanded my knowledge, and forged enduring relationships. Standing before the statue of Svante Arrhenius, whose work had inspired me since my high school days, was a surreal and gratifying experience.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip wasn't just a nostalgic journeyâ€”it rekindled deep emotions, gratitude, and a profound appreciation for the enduring connections that have shaped my life. I am thankful for these experiences and inspired by the cyclical nature of life, where past and present intertwine to create a tapestry of memories and growth.
